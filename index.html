  <p id="tribute-info">As one of the most popular DJs of the late-2000s EDM boom, Grammy-nominated Swedish producer Avicii rose to the top of the charts in multiple countries and toured the world with his uplifting house anthems. Emerging in 2008, he made a name for himself on the electronic circuit before breaking into the international mainstream with his breakout hit, "Levels." The chart-topper was certified platinum across the globe and he soon became a fixture at both festivals and on the radio. His debut album, 2013's True, included a trio of chart-topping singles: "Wake Me Up," "You Make Me," and "Hey Brother." He continued to juggle the underground and the mainstream, remaining on the charts and racking up platinum certifications while pushing his sound in fresh directions on EPs and DJ mixes. Months after the release of his sixth EP, Avici (01), the young producer was found dead in Oman from self-inflicted wounds. He was 28. A year after his passing, the posthumous album TIM was issued.</p>
